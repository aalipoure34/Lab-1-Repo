# Welcome to Eamon Aalipour's WebPage.

![Here's a Photo of Me](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFRjIXisf4Gqg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1593136914665?e=1636588800&v=beta&t=7rTc1-lUrVTXnL1LtuDSurjEdMVlwiGFls3JrJ7npdQ)

## This page was made for Lab 1 of CSE 110.

### You can find one of the screenshots of me working on this general lab here [at this link](screenshots/VSCodeBranch.PNG).

To make this page, I used:

- GitHub Flavored Markdown/GitHub
- Git
- VSCode
- The Terminal (Git Bash)

Here's a bit more about me. First, here's one of my favorite quotes. It's from Mary Shelley's book *Frankenstein*.

> "Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful."

Now, a bit more about what I do. I'm currently studying computer science at UC San Diego. It seems only yesterday that I wrote my first lines of code:

```

public class Eamon {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
      System.out.println("Hello There!");
      
  }
  
}

```

That was the first bits of code I wrote when I first took AP Computer Science A at [Torrey Pines High School](http://tp.sduhsd.net/). 

Since then I've written quite a bit more code as I enrolled in university, most recently as an intern at Humana. 

I always want to learn more programming languages. Here's where I'm at right now:

- [x] Java
- [x] Python
- [x] C
- [x] C++
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] C#
- [ ] Kotlin

### But let's put code aside for a bit and look at my goals ahead.

I'm mostly looking to expand my own knowledge this year and become more prepared for the job industry ahead while also staying as healthy as possible. 
Specifically, I narrow down my goals to these in priority order:

1. Learn as much as I can from my classes and always pay attention.
2. Attend more networking events and learn from my older peers.
3. Maintain a good balance between working and relaxation.

That's it for my profile! Thanks for visiting :D.
