## This page was made for Lab 1 of CSE 110.

### You can find one of the screenshots of me working on this general lab here [at this link](screenshots/VSCodeBranch.PNG).

To make this page, I used

- GitHub Flavored Markdown/GitHub
- Git
- VSCode
- The Terminal (Git Bash)

Here's a bit more about me. First, here's one of my favorite quotes. It's from Mary Shelley's book *Frankenstein*.

> "Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful."

### What I Do

Now, a bit more about what I do. I'm currently studying computer science at UC San Diego. It seems only yesterday that I wrote my first lines of code:

```

public class Eamon {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
      System.out.println("Hello There!");
      
  }
  
}

```

That was the first bits of code I wrote when I first took AP Computer Science A at [Torrey Pines High School](http://tp.sduhsd.net/). 

Since then I've written quite a bit more code as I enrolled in university, most recently as an intern at Humana. 

I always want to learn more programming languages. Here's where I'm at right now:

- [x] Java
- [x] Python
- [x] C
- [x] C++
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] C#    

# Goals

I'm mostly looking to expand my own knowledge this year and become more prepared for the job industry ahead while also staying as healthy as possible. 
Specifically, I narrow down my goals to these in order of priority:

1. Make sure to attend class and do the best I can in each of them.
2. Attain a healthy balance between working hard and exercising, relaxing, etc.
3. Attend networking events and learn from my older peers and mentors.

There's obviously too many to list, but this is a good starting point for now.

That's it for my profile! Thanks for visiting :D.
